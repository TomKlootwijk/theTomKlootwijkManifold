# Native Android Guide — 3.9.1

## Checked-in project

Open `android/UGTSKC391Signature` in Android Studio. The same project can be regenerated:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m ugts_kc3 build-android   examples/tom_signature_arena_3d/project.json   build/UGTSKC391Signature
```

## Toolchain baseline

- Android SDK/compile SDK 36; target SDK 36; min SDK 26.
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.13.2 and Gradle 8.13.
- Android NDK r29 (`29.0.14206865`) and CMake 3.22.1.
- JDK 17 or newer accepted by the selected AGP (the release environment used JDK 21 for host work).

The source package intentionally omits private signing keys and does not fabricate an APK.

## Variants

- `pocoX7ProDebug`: ARM64-only and explicitly selects `poco_x7_pro_12gb`.
- `universalDebug`: ARM64, ARMv7 and x86_64; runtime selection chooses high, balanced or
  compatibility tiers from model/GPU/RAM/GLES/refresh information.

## Runtime architecture

`NativeActivity` owns lifecycle and input. C++ loads `signature_scene.kc3d`, selects a profile,
creates an EGL ES 3 context, renders to a scaled offscreen framebuffer, blits to the display,
runs fixed-step gameplay, and adjusts the quality index after sustained frame or thermal stress.

## Controls

Left touch moves. Right drag orbits. Two-finger spacing changes camera distance. Keyboard uses
WASD/arrows and Space. Gamepads use left/right sticks and A.

## POCO tuning

The signature tier requests 120 fps, 1.0 render scale, up to 1024 visible nodes and ARM64.
This is a target policy, not a guarantee: Android, the display mode, thermal state and workload
can reduce the effective frame rate. The adaptive controller degrades safely when needed.
